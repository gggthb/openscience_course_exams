## FINAL EXAM

The final exam consists of open and closed questions and R programming exercises.

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository to start your final exam. Thereafter, [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) it in your local computer from the command line

```
git clone https://github.com/dncgst/openscience_course_exams.git

The final exam is an R Markdown document (.Rmd). Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Complete your final exam by editing the .Rmd document. First off, fill out the YALM headers with your full name and the submission date. Then, answer the questions and complete the chunks of R code.

Upon completion of your final exam, by click the `Knit` button in RStudio an HTML document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Stage, commit and push your changes. Submit your final exam by [creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Best of luck!
